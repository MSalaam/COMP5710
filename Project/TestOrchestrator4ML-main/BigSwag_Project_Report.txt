BigSwag Project ReportBrenden Rice, John Mulligan, Moe Salaam1.  Git Hooks		A pre-commit hook was added that would run bandit on the repo and print the results in an output.csv. Because the .git directory isn’t tracked it is explained that you need to add the pre-commit file to the .git/hooks directory for it to run. This saves a output.csv file in the root directory, something I realized that caused some issues with being able to push changes. After an output.csv is made it needs to be moved from the folder before you can do a new commit, otherwise the commit gets blocked. Here is an example of the output.csv:filename,test_name,test_id,issue_severity,issue_confidence,issue_cwe,issue_text,line_number,col_offset,line_range,more_info../BigSwag-SQA2022-AUBURN/TestOrchestrator4ML/TestOrchestrator4ML-main/generation/probability_based_label_perturbation.py,blacklist,B311,LOW,HIGH,https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/330.html,Standard pseudo-random generators are not suitable for security/cryptographic purposes.,28,40,[28],https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.4/blacklists/blacklist_calls.html#b311-random../BigSwag-SQA2022-AUBURN/TestOrchestrator4ML/TestOrchestrator4ML-main/label_perturbation_attack/probability_based_label_perturbation.py,blacklist,B311,LOW,HIGH,https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/330.html,Standard pseudo-random generators are not suitable for security/cryptographic purposes.,28,40,[28],https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.4/blacklists/blacklist_calls.html#b311-random../BigSwag-SQA2022-AUBURN/TestOrchestrator4ML/TestOrchestrator4ML-main/select_repos/dev_count.py,blacklist,B404,LOW,HIGH,https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html,Consider possible security implications associated with the subprocess module.,7,0,[7],https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.4/blacklists/blacklist_imports.html#b404-import-subprocess../BigSwag-SQA2022-AUBURN/TestOrchestrator4ML/TestOrchestrator4ML-main/select_repos/dev_count.py,start_process_with_partial_path,B607,LOW,HIGH,https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html,Starting a process with a partial executable path,26,24,[26],https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.4/plugins/b607_start_process_with_partial_path.html../BigSwag-SQA2022-AUBURN/TestOrchestrator4ML/TestOrchestrator4ML-main/select_repos/dev_count.py,subprocess_without_shell_equals_true,B603,LOW,HIGH,https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html,subprocess call - check for execution of untrusted input.,26,24,[26],https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.4/plugins/b603_subprocess_without_shell_equals_true.html
